# Supermarket Data Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for my supermarket data analysis project. The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset from a supermarket and derive actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

# Project Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the supermarket data using Jupyter Notebook. The main techniques utilized include:

## Clustering: I applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This allowed for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.

## Classification: I implemented classification algorithms to predict customer churn, enabling the development of proactive retention strategies and improving customer loyalty.

## Time Series Analysis (ARIMA): I employed Time Series ARIMA models to forecast sales and identify seasonal trends. This provided insights for optimizing inventory management and resource allocation.

# Repository Structure
data: This folder contains the dataset used for the analysis.

notebooks: This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook files used for the analysis. The notebooks are organized based on the techniques employed (clustering, classification, time series analysis).
